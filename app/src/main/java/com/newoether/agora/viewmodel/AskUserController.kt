/**
 * Coordinates `ask_user` requests between the tool loop, which asks, and the interaction bar,
 * which answers.
 *
 * Requests stack: parallel conversations and repeated tool calls can all be waiting, so the state
 * is an ordered list instead of a single slot and every answer carries its request id.
 *
 * A request is either blocking or not, and that choice belongs to the caller:
 *
 * - blocking: the tool call suspends until the answer arrives. There is no timeout, because a
 *   question the user has not seen yet must not decide itself; stopping the generation is what ends
 *   an unwanted wait.
 * - non-blocking: the tool call returns at once and the model keeps working. The answer is
 *   published through [deferredAnswers] and reaches the model as a queued user message, the same
 *   path a message typed during a generation takes.
